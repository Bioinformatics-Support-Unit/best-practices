# best-practices

BSU recommended workflows and best practices.

Will include example scripts and documentation for major analysis types, including Illumina BeadArrays, RNA-Seq and more.

Where possible, tool recommendations are evidence-based and tested. No parameter recommendations should be assumed for any tool - these should be based on the data in hand.
